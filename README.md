## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/1904/blob/main/1904_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

1 -> 1

2 -> 00 , 11

3 -> 001, 100, 111

4 -> 0000, 0011, 1001, 1100, 1111

As you can see, there is only 2 options to attach to the existing number.

1. add 00 at the end.

2. add 1 at the end.

Adding 00 at the (i-2) length number and adding 1 at the (i-1) length number can make i length number.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
